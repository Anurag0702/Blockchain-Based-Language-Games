# Blockchain-Based Language Games

## Project Description
The "Blockchain-Based Language Games" project introduces a decentralized application (dApp) designed to enhance language learning and linguistic interaction through gamification. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform provides an immutable and transparent system for players to submit word translations, vote on their accuracy, and earn rewards for contributing valid translations.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to create a fun, engaging, and decentralized ecosystem for language enthusiasts worldwide. By combining gamification with the security and transparency of blockchain, we aim to foster a collaborative and competitive environment for language learning and translation validation.

## Key Features

### 1. **Decentralized Translation Submission**
Players can submit translations of words, which are stored transparently on the blockchain.

### 2. **Community Voting**
Other participants can vote on the submitted translations to ensure accuracy and fairness.

### 3. **Score Rewards**
Players earn scores for submitting accurate translations that receive favorable votes from the community.

### 4. **Automatic Resolution**
Translations are resolved automatically once a predefined number of votes (5) is reached, determining their acceptance or rejection.

### 5. **Transparency and Immutability**
All transactions, including translation submissions, votes, and scores, are recorded immutably on the blockchain.
